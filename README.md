### 1. Revenue vs budget

#### Revenue versus budget analysis is the most basic metric for financial income analysis. Based on a company's pre-defined budget, it is possible to know if the company will be able to achieve its goals.

### 2. Current revenue vs Same period last year

#### Just like the indicator mentioned above, the revenue value can be compared with the values ​for the same period last year. This way, we can confirm business growth and prepare future budgets.

### 3. Revenue by operations

#### For the vast majority of companies, revenue figures can derive from a variety of operational activities. Operational activities must also be monitored to understand their share of total revenue and to view changes over time.

### 4. % budget reached

#### The percentage of the budget achieved shows how the company's revenue is evolving over the selected period. This indicator is extremely important for validating the chosen revenue forecasting method and determines how the future budget will be prepared.

### 5. Revenue evolution month over month

#### This indicator becomes important for understanding the growth or reduction behavior of revenue over the months. It becomes even more important if the company detects a time series pattern such as seasonality in its revenue values.
